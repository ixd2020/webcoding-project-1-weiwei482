  <p>Largely on the basis of the works of the last three years of his life, van Gogh is generally considered one of the greatest Dutch painters of all time.
    His work exerted a powerful influence on the development of much modern painting, in particular on the works of the Fauve painters, Chaim Soutine, and the
    German Expressionists. Yet of the more than 800 oil paintings and 700 drawings that constitute his lifeâ€™s work, he sold only one in his lifetime. Always 
    desperately poor, he was sustained by his faith in the urgency of what he had to communicate and by the generosity of Theo, who believed in him implicitly. 
    The letters that he wrote to Theo from 1872 onward, and to other friends, give such a vivid account of his aims and beliefs, his hopes and disappointments,
    and his fluctuating physical and mental state that they form a unique and touching biographical record that is also a great human document.</p>
