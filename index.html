      Vincent Willem van Gogh 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is amongst<br>
      the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks,<br>
      including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes,<br> 
      portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed<br> 
      to the foundations of modern art. He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness, <br>
      depression and poverty.

     Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet, and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art dealer, 
      often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium.
      He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially,
      and the two kept a long correspondence by letter. His early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour that 
      distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against 
      the Impressionist sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local landscapes. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed
      a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of olive trees, 
      wheat fields and sunflowers.
